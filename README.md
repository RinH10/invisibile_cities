The starting point for this project was a question about method: could the Large Language Model (LLM) workflow we encountered in our Week 8 class, which was designed to generate maps from real-world geographic texts, be adapted for literary analysis? Specifically, could this approach be applied to texts that are also centered on space and travel, but where the "geography" is more conceptual than physical?

To test this idea, I chose Italo Calvino's fictional text, *Invisible Cities*, as the subject. It's a fictional account where Marco Polo describes the many cities he has visited on his world travels to Kublai Khan. The final workflow, adapted from the original one provided by my instructor, demonstrates a viable process for turning abstract literary concepts into a spatial visualization.

The initial step was using an LLM (Gemini) to parse the text and output structured data as a CSV file. I designed a prompt for the LLM to identify and categorize keywords, moods, and symbolic features from each city's description. Next, a Python script using the Pandas library was used to process this CSV. The script performed two key functions: first, it extracted a single `primary_theme` from a string of multiple keywords, and second, it converted the entire dataset into a web-map-friendly GeoJSON format. The coordinates for each data point were programmatically generated based on its theme category. The final visualization was rendered as a single-page web app using MapLibre GL JS, which displays the GeoJSON data and includes JavaScript for interactive features like hover popups and a dynamic legend. The Google Colab project shows most part of the automation process, from the PDF reading to the HTML file generation, though part of the visualization functions are modified separately. (An example of this project can be viewed at rinh10.github.io/invisible_cities).

I ran into a few challenges during implementation. A major one was that the Gemini API has strict copyright restrictions. My original prompt, which read and edited the source text, produced content that was too similar to Calvino's original novel, causing the API to fail in generating the CSV file. The solution was to adjust the prompt to have the LLM extract summarized keywords rather than direct quotes (though this arguably goes against the spirit of Digital Humanities...). Another main issue was data incompatibility. Since the text is fictional, it contains no real geographic coordinates. The CSV file generated by the Pandas library used `NaN` to represent these missing numerical values, but `NaN` is not valid in the JSON standard. This required adding a data-cleaning step to the Python script to explicitly convert `NaN` values to `null` before serialization, ensuring the browser could successfully parse the GeoJSON file.

In short, this project confirmed that an LLM-based mapping workflow can be successfully used to interpret conceptual, fictional texts. It provides a viable technical template for applying GIS visualization techniques to digital humanities and textual analysis. The questions that follow are about the interpretive potential of this workflow. For instance, how should we decide on the themes and their spatial distribution on the map? How can we move beyond the limits of real-world geography to "visualize" our perception of travel memories? This seems full of promising directions for future development.
