        "3.  **Text Field Quoting:** After performing internal comma replacement, all fields containing text (this includes `city_name` and all other descriptive/analytical columns) **MUST** be enclosed in a pair of double quotes (`\"`). `latitude`, `longitude` (when \"N/A\"), and `city_id` (when a plain number) do not need these enclosing quotes.\n",
        "4.  **Escaping Internal Double Quotes:** If a field's content (after internal comma replacement) itself contains a double quote character (`\"`), that internal double quote **MUST** be escaped by replacing it with two double quotes (`\"\"`). The entire field must then also be enclosed in its own pair of double quotes. For example: `\"Keywords_like_\"\"Quoted Term\"\"_etc\"`\n",
        "5.  Ensure every data row has exactly 10 fields.\n",
        "6.  Pay very close attention to these formatting rules.\n",
